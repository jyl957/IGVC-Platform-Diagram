# IGVC-Platform-Diagram
Project Name：IGVC Design
Project Description： IGVC（Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition）is an annual international robotics competition for teams of undergraduate and graduate students. Vehicle must detect the boundary lines and obstacles automatically. Vehicle must have automatic mode and remote-control mode. Mechanical E-stop button and wireless E-stop button should be set to bring the vehicle to a quick and complete stop. Safety lights will indicate the current state of vehicle.
Project Responsibility： The circuit platform of vehicle was designed as required by competition rules. All the wires connection were completed. The proper wire size and electrical components were selected to build the hardware system of vehicle. The electrical safety measure was formulated to prevent short circuit. The circuit was optimized to make it easy to maintain.
